## üßë‚Äçüíª How It Works

1. **Authentication**  
   Google login is handled via NextAuth.js. JWT sessions store user identity, synced with Supabase through Prisma.

2. **Invoice Builder**  
   A step-wise accordion form captures user inputs like company info, client details, items, and notes.

3. **Live Preview**  
   Real-time preview of invoice with calculated totals using controlled form state and Redux.

4. **Data Persistence**  
   Invoices are saved in Supabase and scoped to each user using their JWT session.

5. **Access Control**  
   API routes check sessions via `next-auth/jwt`, allowing only the logged-in user's invoices to be fetched or modified.
